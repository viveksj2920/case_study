# Problem Statment

The problem statement is about determining the number of ways for a student to attend classes over N days and the probability of missing the graduation ceremony, where the student cannot miss classes for Four or more consecutive days.
<br></br>

# The Solution

The solution involves using dynamic programming to find the number of ways to attend and not attend classes over N days. The probability of missing the graduation ceremony is then calculated by dividing the number of ways to not attend the graduation ceremony by the total number of ways to attend classes over N days.

# Code Directory explanation

The solution is written in two different approaches along with test cases and different time and space complexity.

```Before downloading code make sure you install VS code and python 3.7.2 ```

# Steps to execute Solution 1.

    1. First clone or download the repository.
    2. Navigate to the directory and open with vs code
    3. Type this cmd to get into solution_1 dir.

```
cd Solution_1
```

### There are three ways to see the solution for first approach whose time complexity is O(n).


Input already in code

```
python main.py
```
Input from user
```
python input_from_user.py
````

Test cases
```
python test_cases.py
```

# Steps to execute Solution 2.

    1. First clone or download the repository.
    2. Navigate to the directory and open with vs code
    3. Type this cmd to get into solution_1 dir.

```
cd Solution_2
```
If you are already in solution_1 dir and want to navigate to solution_2 dir, follow these commands

```
cd ../
cd solution_2
```
### There are two ways to see the solution for second approach whose time complexity is O(N * M).

Input already in code
```
python main.py
```

Test cases
```
python test_cases.py
```
